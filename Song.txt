Little ghost, you're listening,
Unlike most you don't miss a thing,
You see the truth
I walk the halls invisibly,
I climb the walls, no one sees me,
No one but you.
You've always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wing's still beating,
You've always loved the stranger inside
Me, ugly pretty
Oh oh, no no no, oh
